            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Mmediatlye after you had cauſed your articles to be put in printe (beloued in Chriſt) I was ſtirred wyth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre to haue them confuted. Not for any diſpleaſure that I had conceyned towardes you, or anye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by whoſe meanes you ſhoulde be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or (as it maye be thought) required to ſet them abrod to the world: but onelye for the loue I beare to Chriſtes trueth, whyche I woulde not (if my wit and knowledge were coreſpondente to my wyll) ſuffer to be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by anye ſo blaſphemouſe doctrine of Antichriſtes ſchole, as are theſe Articles of yours. I call them yours, bycauſe you ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to them, and ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forthe vnder your name. But if I were required to ſay my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: I coulde not deny but I thinke them to be Wyncheſters workemanſhyp, becauſe they agre ſo well wyth hys doctrine, &amp; that
<pb facs="tcp:5410:5"/> chiefelye in the deuyl leiſhe detection of hys maiſter the deuylles ſophiſtry, whych he ſet abroud ſhortly after theſe Articles of yours But woulde God you were as well confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by me, as he is anſwered by Anthony Gilbie. Wel, as I coulde ſo haue I done, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would not that ſo neceſſarie a thyng ſhold be left vndone. Not for the ſcarſitie of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be able to do it much better: but by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none other hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in hande, neyther was it lyke that any woulde hereafter occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py theyr tyme in it, becauſe the matter doeth nowe dayly more &amp; more grow out of mind And becauſe the copies of youre Articles be not communly to be ſolde: moſt men thinke them in maner extinguiſhed for euer. And in very dede, had not certaine honeſte men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed me of the great numbre of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that thorowe youre recantation were eſtabliſhed in your erroures: I hadde not taken this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprice in hande, nother yet finiſhed it when it was begon. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I vnderſtode what hynderaunce to Gods trueth, your Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, hath already and myghte here after do if your articles ſhould remayne vntouched: I thought it to leſſe then neceſſarye to ſpend ſome tyme in it, truſting that God wil geue the encreaſe boeth in youre herte and in the hertes of as many as are not obſtinate blind veſſels of Gods Ire ordeyned to deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>

For that were euen to ſteale Gods worde, lyke as theues ſteale other mennes goodes, and apply them to theyr own vſes. So is that a ſtealynge of Gods word, and appliyng of it to our own vſes, that is to the defence of our own euil opinions. Agaynſte whom that ſo do ſpeaketh Eſai the prophet.

               <p>Are not my wordes euen as fyre ſayeth the Lorde, and as an hammer that breaketh the ſtone?

Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge myne opions trueth it is, that I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſente in opinions from diuers good, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and excellentlye learned men.

Therfore in ſuche poyntes I vary not from anye chriſten man, laye, or learned: but

Therfore the poyntes wherein I diſſente frome other (both good and learned men) are no neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye poyntes, neither ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> places: but obſcure harde, and hydden miſteries of the whyche that ſentence maye be well vnderſtand that is wrytten in the thyrd chapter of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticus.

In ſuche thynges I ſaye onely, do I diſſent from other and not els. Wherfore it is a thynge to be marneyled and wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at, that the biſhops with ſuche furie and fyerſnes (lyke mad men) burne and ſlea vp the Kynges people (as they do) for thynges not certayne nor neceſſarie to be knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but opinable matters and diſputable.

That is to ſaye, loue theim, delite in theim, and do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For if they did: ſurely they ſhold know thys our doctrine to be of God, &amp; not of man, accordynge to the ſentence of oure ſauioure Chriſt in the .vii.

So wythout doubte if they were Godlye men and kept Goddes commaundementes they ſhoulde haue come to more knoweledge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be yet come to. For as ſayeth our ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſte. Mathe .xiii.

Doeth not he that perſecuteth hys brother, burneth hym, and kylleth hym, hate hys brother? Then muſt it inſue &amp; folowe, that he is in darknes and blindnes, for hys malyce blyndeth him, &amp; ſo he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not iudge of gods doctrine that he hath ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde, &amp; is growe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer more &amp; more and encreaſeth by theyr perſecution.

                  <p>Thys is ſone ſpoken. But to proue by the ſcriptures, that it is true: therein lieth all the difficultie of the matter. Here (I am ſure your foure ſcholemaiſters wyll ſaye. That it is done, is manifeſte by the ſcriptures. But howe it is done, reaſon can not attayne to knowe. Wherefore we muſte agaynſte reaſon, beleue the wonderful worke of God aboue reaſon.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5410:25"/>
                  <p>Yet am not I ſatiſfied. Neither can I beleue that they can proue by the ſcripturs: that the breade and wyne are turned into the bodye and bloud of Chriſt. Let your ſcholmaiſters therefore (or els do you theyr ſcholer) ſhew me what ſcripture you haue for thys youre opinion. I am certayne you haue none at al<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> excepte it be one that you are wont to wreſt for your purpoſe, and that is thys.</p>
                  <p>The Lorde Ieſus in the ſame night in the whyche he was betrayed, toke breade, gaue thankes, and brake it ſayinge. Take ye, eate ye, thys is my bodye, whyche is broken for you. Hereupon I am ſure you wil infer: his conclution. Ergo, the breade is turned into hys bodye.

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. &amp; cetera.</p>
                  <p>Thus haue ye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed this parte. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaye you of the wyne. After the ſame maner alſo he toke the cup when ſupper was done and ſayed. Thys cup is the newe teſtament in my bloud. Thys do (as ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ye drinke it) in the remembraunce of me. Here ſay you and your ſcholemaiſters. The ſame Chriſte whych is able to perfourme hys word, hath
<pb facs="tcp:5410:25"/> ſayed of the breade and wyne that they are hys bodye and bloude. Ergo they muſte nedes be hys very naturall body and bloud al ſubſtaunce of breade and wyne turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame. I doubte not but ther is all that you and your ſcholemaiſters woulde deſyre me to conclude for your purpoſe. To thys I (wyth Goddes helpe) wyl make ſuche an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that you and all other youre fauters ſhal be aſhamed to wreſte it ſo farre oute of tune here after.</p>
                  <p>For the fyrſte parte you ſhal vnderſtand that I haue taken the text wrytten by ſaynct Paul to the Corinthyans, bycauſe this place of Paule is an expoſition of the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wrytte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Euangeliſtes.

Seynge therfore, that Chriſt toke bread, &amp; gaue thankes: it muſte nedes folowe that he gaue ſuche thankes as the fathers (the patriarckes and Prophetes) vſed to geue. Neyther makyng ſygne of the croſſe nor of the galow tree (for it had bene all one, to make the ſygne of the croſſe then, and to make the ſigne of the galow tre uow For as theues and all other perniciouſe fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, be nowe hanged on the galowe tree: ſo were they then on che croſſe) but wyth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerente geſture of the bodye, and vpryghte countenaunce towarde heauen: he called on the name of hys father, moſte humbly beſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge hym, to worcke inwardly in the her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of hys Apoſtles, the thynge that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to declare to theim by a viſible ſigne And. S.

                  <p>In token whereof, they committed vnto hys mercye alſo, theyr dearlye beloued chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, moſt humbly beſechyng hym, to ſhew lyke mercye vnto theim in proſperynge the ſucceſſion of theyr enheritaunce, that they by the aſſiſtent grace of God, myght walke in the feare of the Lorde, from generation to generation foreuer.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5410:26"/>
                  <p>Thus dyd Chriſte bleſſe and brake it. If I ſhoulde aſke you what he brake: I doubte not but you woulde anſwere that he brake breade, and ſayed, take ye, eateye, thys is my body. But if I ſhould aſke you what it was that he called hys bodye: then I know your anſwer woulde be after youre olde maner, that the ſame breade that he toke and brake, was it that he called hys bodye.</p>
                  <p>But I wyl ſhew you a lyke thyng to proue whether you can learne to vnderſtand this place of ſcripture by a ſimile. Apelles toke penſell and paper and drewe theron, &amp; ſayed This is Venus. Nowe aſke I you whether thys that Apelles ſpake of were Venus in dede, or hyr Image.? I doubte not, you wyl ſaye not Venus but hyr Image. Then tell me. Was the penſell and paper hyr Image, or the luniamentes that Apelles? The lines you ſaye drawen on the paper, and not the paper otherwiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the glaſſe is the Image of a mans face whyche appeareth therin.</p>
                  <p>Euen ſo ſay I of theſe wordes of Chriſt. Thys is my bodie. He toke breade, he brake it, gaue it to his diſciples &amp; ſaid. This is my bodye. As who ſhould ſay, this breade bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to you, &amp; receiued of you is a cleare image of mi body, which is by the wil of my father broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> frely offred &amp; geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to you &amp; by faieth receyued of you, ſo that in like maner
<pb facs="tcp:5410:27"/> as this breade is receyued into the body and naturally nouriſheth the ſame: ſo doth it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to you by that naturall propertie, that my bodye eaten by fayeth (that is by bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge and truſtynge vpon ſaluation by my ſufferynges in the bodye) doeth nouriſh the ſoules of as manye as do ſo eate it.</p>
                  <p>In lyke maner toke he the cup after ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſaying. Thys cup is the new teſtament in my bloude. Here maye you (if you haue anye lytle glitteryng of the ſpiritual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) eaſilye perceyue that Paule knewe of no traunſubſtantiation in thys miſterie,</p>
                  <p>For he reporteth that he learned of the Lord all that he taught the Corhinthyans co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge thys miſterye: and yet he reporteth that Chriſt ſayed of the cuppe. Thys is the newe teſtamente in my bloude. And thyuke you, that if Paule were here, he woulde ſay that he beleued the ſubſtaunce of the cup to be chaunged into the ſubſtaunce of the new teſtament? I knowe well you do not thynke it. For your opinion is, that by the vertue of thoſe wordes, the wyne whiche is in the cup is turned into the verye bloude of Chriſte. And yet do not the wordes appertayne any thynge at all to the wyne, vnleſſe you wyll admitte the fygure whereby the thynge that conteyueth is taken for the thyng conteined. And ſo doynge, you muſt ſaye that the wine
<pb facs="tcp:5410:27"/> is the newe Teſtament in Chriſtes blander and not the bloud it ſelf. So that if you wyl nedes haue traunſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciation: it muſt be of the ſubſtaunce of wyne, into the ſubſtaunce of the new teſtament. That is the certentye wherby oure conſciences are certified of the promiſe of God made to vs in the ſcripture.</p>
                  <p>Wyth thys tranſubſtanciation we could beare, if ſo be you would not denye, that the ſubſtaunce of breade and wyne doeth ſtil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne, declarynge vnto vs ſenſibly (by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſygnes) the thynge that is in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture taught vs by wordes. For immediatly after, Chriſte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſayeth. Do thys ſo ofte as ye ſhall drinke to the entente to remembre me therby. That is to ſaye. So ofte as you wil make youre ſelues partakers of one cup of wyne, to the entente tu call to your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce thereby, the greate miſterie of the participation you haue in me and al thinges that I haue or ſhal do for you: do it after this forſayed fourme. So that by thys are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned, as wel the priuate maſſes, wherin one miniſtreth and receyueth al, as the freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tranſubſtaneiation, whereupon is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ſacrifice for the quicke and the dead, as ſhall be declared more at large in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall articies concernynge the ſame.</p>
                  <p>To perſwade one that were wyllyng to learne, thys were ſufficiente. But ſeyng that
<pb facs="tcp:5410:28"/> you &amp; your ſchomaiſters are more readye to burn me &amp; al other that ſeke your ſoul health (God geue you a better mynde) then to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept our dortrine: I am co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to labour to drawe you by force of argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyſe, then Hercuſes drewe the froward Cerberus out of hell. I wyll therefore make thys argument, grounded on the definition of breade. Breade is a confection made of manye graynes, vnited or made into one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, by the myxture of water, and force of fyre, hauynge in it the vertue to nouriſhe the ſenſible bodyes.</p>
                  <p>But thys confection remayneth after the conſecration (as you call it) Ergo, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth breade. That thys co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth: I take wytnes of my Lorde of winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in hys boke wrytten on thys matter.</p>

Let me haue daylie a ſufficiente weyghte &amp; meaſure of that conſecrated breade &amp; wyne, and ſhute me vp frome all other kynde of ſuſtinaunce. But thys one thyng I would deſyre. That the breade and wyne ye conſecrate: be free from all kyndes of poyſon. For thoughe I do knowe that God is able to preſerue me frome all maner of poyſon: yet wyl I not, neyther maye I tempte my Lorde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God ſo far. But if you, do poyſon me, I ſhall glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
<pb facs="tcp:5410:28"/> ſuffer it for the trueth ſake.</p>

Wherefore if you grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that it remaineth ſtil the body &amp; bloud of Chriſte, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dinge the putrifactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: you muſt nedes grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te alſo, that you burne the bodie &amp; bloud Chriſt.

                  <p>For if it remayne the bodye and bloud of Chriſt whyle it is ſwet: then doth it remaine in the ſame eſtate for euer.

                  <p>But experience teacheth vs, that it remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not ſtyll incorruptible. Ergo the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce is not alltered at all.

                  <p>For as onely God is diuine, ſo muſt diuine honoure be geueu vnto hym onelye. If theſe Sacramentes therefore be not God. What can it be leſſe then Idolatrye, to honour the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wyth diuine honoure?</p>

But I thynke verye ſhame wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pel you to recant certaine of youre former words, &amp; to ſay that you meane not, that the ſubſtan<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the bread is turned into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce of god, but that it is (thorowe the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty word of god ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the prieſt) tur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned into the ſubſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the body of Chriſt. And that you infer thereupon the eſſentiall preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the deitie, for that they be inſepera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bly vnited togyther. A fyr, if you wyl grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t me thys, I ſe well you wyll not ſtande to your fyrſte Article: wherin you affirme, that after the wordes of conſecration, ther remai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth no ſubſtaunce of breade and wyne but the onely and verye ſubſtaunce of Chriſte God and man. For if you ſaie that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce of the breade is not turned into the ſubſtaunce of the godhead: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is he none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyſe in the bread after the conſecration then he was before. Before the conſecration the breade was not to be honoured with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue honour: therfore it is not to be honored with diuine honour at all. But here you wyl ſaie that although the ſubſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the bread be not turned into the ſubſtaunce of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head yet is God otherwiſe preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecration, then it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For the ſecond perſon in trinitie beinge
<pb facs="tcp:5410:34"/> incarnate, and remaynynge inſeparablye v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitted to the father and to the holye Goſte. it muſte neades be that the manheade of the ſame perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beynge riſen agayne from death is inſeperablye vnited to the Godheade, ſo that the Godheade is alwayes eſſentiallye preſente wyth the bodye.</p>
                  <p>All thys is true, but it foloweth not of thys, that the Godheade is otherwyſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſente in the bread after your conſecration (as you cal it) then it was before, bicauſe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye wherein Chriſte is incarnate, is not nor can not be ſubſtanciallye preſente there. For that were as much to ſaye, as that the body wherin Chriſt is incarnate, is ſo mixed with the deite, that it is in al places at once, as the deitie is. Whyche ſayinge is agaynſte the doctrine of Athanatius in the Creede that you ſynge and reade daylye in your prime. Wherin he ſayeth. Deus et homo vnus eſt Chriſtus, non confuſione ſubſtantie, ſed v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate perſone.</p>
                  <p>That is, Chriſte beinge but one, is boeth God and manne. Not by the mixture of the ſubſtaunce, but by the vnitie of the perſon. If the ſubſtaunce therfore of God and man be not myxed togyther: then is not the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heade ſo large to be in all places, as the dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is.

                  <p>Before I canne ſaye anye thynge in thys matter, I muſte knowe what churche it is, that doeth as you ſaye offer vp thys ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, by the miniſtration of the prieſte. Is it the ſame churche that offered vp Chriſte on the croſſe, or is it the churche that was rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by that ſacrifice: If it be the ſame churh that offered vp Chriſte on the croſſe, then it is the congregation of the wycked. For ſo ſayeth the Prophete. The wycked haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted me. But I am ſure you wyl ſay, it is the churche that was redemed by that ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that offreth it vp now by the miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the priſt. Here I might axe of you, how you coulde proue to me, either by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or by auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t doctors, that the churche redemed by that ſacrifice, may offer it vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne ſo often, to the entente to redeme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues therebye? But to that you wyll an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that they offer it not vp for theyr re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for they were redemed once for al. Yet wyl not I be ſuffiſed wyth thys anſwer For I am ſure you ſay in the ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>non of your maſſe, theſe wordes. For the redemption of the ſoules of thy churche. But I wyll not muche contend wyth you in this matter, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am fully perſwaded that your own conſcience crieth out againſte you therin.</p>
                  <p>Shew me (I pray you therfore) ſome one
<pb facs="tcp:5410:37"/> ſentence of the ſcripture, or of the aunciente Doctours, that maye ſeeme to mayntayne youre aſſertion. You wyll perchaunce recite me the wordes of Paule to the Hebrues, ſay inge, Euerye prieſte is ready, dayly offering vp ſacrifice for ſinne. This maketh ſo much for your purpoſe, that if you reade the nexte ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce folowing, you ſhal ſone ſe it marreth all youre market. For it foloweth. Which can neuer take awaye ſynne. If that whiche is offered vp by the prieſte, can neuer take awaye ſynne, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is it not the ſame that was offered vpon the croſſe, for that toke away ſinne, yea and was of force to take awaye al the ſynnes of the worlde.</p>
                  <p>But to what purpoſe ſhoulde it be to make manye wordes aboute this texte, ſeyng that it is manifeſte, that Paule doeth here ſpeake of the prieſtes and ſacrifices of the old lawe onelye, and not of anye ſacrifice to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red amonge chriſtians. Yea, not muche after the words cited, he is not afraied to ſay that ther is no more ſacrifice to be offered for ſin.</p>
                  <p>Yet bycauſe you Sacrificers are wonte to wreſte this place (as it is manifeſte that you haue done manye other) I thoughte it good to gyue you a wound with your own wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon. And now I ſhal deſpre you to hearken to the wordes of the ſame Paule, to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye of your Article, whyche are theſe.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5410:38"/>
                  <p>No man can offer vp a greater ſacrifice the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym ſelfe. Youre prieſte therefore, can not offer vp Chriſte in ſacrifice, bycauſe Chriſte beynge offered vp muſte nedes be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſte ſacrifice, and ſo canne he not be when a prieſte ſacrificeth hym, for if the prieſt ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed hym ſelfe, he ſhould be the greateſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice that he coulde offer, for no manne can offer a greater ſacrifice then hym ſelfe. Yea God requireth non other ſacrifice of vs, but our ſelues as writeth. S. Paule. Geue your<note place="margin">Roma .xii.</note> ſelues a lyuynge ſacrifice to God. And the Pſalmiſſe. The ſacrifice that God accepteth is a penitente ſpirite, a contrite and humble hert. Wherby it is manifeſte, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation redemed by the ſacrifice offered on the croſſe, doth not nor can not offer vp this ſacrifice you ſpeake of. For (as Paule wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) he can not be offered vp, but he dyeth. Wherefore he offered hym ſelfe once for all, bycauſe he coulde dye but once. Yet graunte he myght die euery day, would you thinke that to be his church that wold kil him eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye day? I thinke not vnles you take Iudas &amp; the Iewes to be of his churche not wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the one betraied him who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other crucified. Thus ſe we that the churche of chriſt knoweth of no ſacrifice that they offer by the miniſtration of the prieſte. But they make theyr own me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres a liuely ſacrifice to

                  <p>An aſſertion worthy a fleſhly philoſopher ſauourynge more of Ariſtotle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt. For if it were graunted that the ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall breade were turned into a lyueynge bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, then woulde Ariſtotle ſaye, that there muſt nedes be bloud in the ſame or els ſome other humoure of the ſame nature to ſupply the office of bloude. Hetherto Ariſtotle taketh youre parte. But when you ſaye, that
<pb facs="tcp:5410:47"/> in the bloude muſte nedes be whole Chriſte boeth bodie and bloude: there Ariſtotle lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth you. For he is not of the opinion that the whole ought to be preſente wyth euerye part, though he affyrme the partes to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarylye preſente wyth the whole. But if you wyll hearken to hym in all hys aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: he wyll teache you, that in euerie natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bodie muſt nedes be a fourme, quantie, and qualitie, to repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it to oure eyes. And that we muſt deſerne and knowe the bodies one from an other, by theyr quantities, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, &amp; fourme that they be of. But I doubt not you wyl forſake Ariſtotle in thys point wherefore I ſhall deſyre you to forſake hym in the other alſo.

Yea, it is the onely vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge, ſtrenghthynge, &amp; defence of the maſſe, when the prieſte eateth and drinketh vp all hymſelfe. For if he ſhoulde diſtribute it to anye other and make theim partakers wyth hym: it ſhoulde not then be a maſſe (whyche name cometh from the market of Rome) but a communion. And if you wyll ſaye (as I ſuppoſe your meanynge is in thys Article) that it is no derogation to the vertue of the communion of the bodye &amp; bloud, of Chriſt that the prieſte receyueth it alone: then muſt I nedes ſaye that it is ſo greate derogation to the vertue thereof, that it is therby decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be no communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at al. For the whole ſtrength and vertue therof, is to ſignifie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs the death of Chriſte, our deliueraunce by the ſame, and the wonderfull knittynge togyther of all the receyuers therof into one
<pb facs="tcp:5410:48"/> bodye: by the faith in Chriſt, the head of the ſame body. And this vertue hath it not whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is receiued of the prieſt onely, neyther can it haue.

If this therfore wherof you ſpeake be the bodye of Chriſte (as you ſaye it is) then can it not be a ſacramente, that is the ſygne of an holye thynge, for it is the holye thynge it ſelfe.

You ſay not that the ſubſtaunce of the bread and wyne, is the Sacramente (for that you ſaye is turned into the bodye and bloude of Chriſt) but the forme of bread &amp; wine which remayneth, you ſay is the ſacramente of the ſame ſubſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce turned into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body &amp; bloud of chriſt. A ſyra, ther ſaid you wel The forme of bread and wine, is the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes body &amp; bloud. Nowe muſte we knowe, what the fourme of a thinge is. The Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers ſay, that the fourme of euery thing

But bycauſe it is ſo harde a thing to finde theſe true differences, that the Philoſophers are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to ſay that ther is no true difference, that is to ſaye, that ther can be no qualitie ſo appropriate to any one kynd, that it may be found in that kynd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, and in euery of that kynde: we muſte of neceſſitie take thoſe qualities for the fourme of thinges whiche be mooſte appropriate to them, &amp; are found in feweſt thinges of other kynd. As the fourme of man, is the power to receyue reaſon. Whiche power is founde is none other kind of thing ſauing in ſpirits Onely ſpirites &amp; man, haue the power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue reaſon. Wherfore they onely are called reaſonable. Bi this we ſe, that the fourme of bread and wine, muſte nedes be that qualitie that is moſt appropriate to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie muſte nedes be the power to nouriſhe.</p>
                  <p>Which power as it is not found in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in all other kindes of ſuſtinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce alſo: ſo is it fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d muſt chiefly in bread &amp; broth, ſo that vnder thoſe names are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of thinges wherupon man feadeth, and without theſe, no fode can be pleaſaunte to the bodye for any longe tyme.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5410:51"/>
                  <p>The power therefore to nouryſhe, is the fourme of breade &amp; wyne. And the fourme of breade and wyne, is the ſacramente of the bodye and bloude of Chriſte. Therefore the power to nowriſhe is the Sacrament of the bodye and bloude of Chriſte. If you alowe thys fourme of breade and wyne to be the ſacrament of the bodye and bloud of Chriſt then am I of the ſame opinion with you.</p>
                  <p>For no doubt Chriſt willed vs to certifi our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces by the nouriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t we fele in bread and wyne, that hys bodye and bloude do in lyke maner nouryſhe the ſoule.

                  <p>You ſeme in thys Article, to aſſigne two impedimentes of mariage. One the dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto God, by the receyuynge of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre of prieſtehode. The other, the vowe of chaſtitie aduiſedlye made. For the fyrſte: I woulde gladelye knowe of you, wheiher it were not the ſame maner of dedication, that was vſed amonge the Iewes in the tyme of Moyſes lawe, that you ſpeake of. If it be the ſame, then is it of no greater force nowe then it was then. That it toke not away the libertie of mariage then, is manifeſte. For it was reproche to a Prieſte to bee wythoute yſhue, and they hadde lawes for theyr mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. They myghte marye no commune or miſſiuynge woman. They myght mary us wyddowe: except it had bene the wyddowe of a prieſte. It can not be therefore, that thys dedicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be an impedimente to mariage.</p>
                  <p>But here you wyll ſaye perchaunce, that thys is not the ſame. For. S. Paule ſayeth
<pb facs="tcp:5410:56"/> playnelye, that for as muche as the prieſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode is traunſlated no remedy the law muſt alſo be traunſlated. I would not wiſh youre iudgement to be ſo ſclender in the ſcriptures that you ſhould take. S. Paul here to meane of anye chaungynge of anye maner of dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catange the prieſtes to God: for Paule en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuonreth none other, but to declare, that lyke as the prieſtehode is nowe traunſlated from the tribe of Leme, to Chriſte and hys ſpiritual generation, whiche are prieſtes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the order of Melchelſiſedeth: ſo muſt the lawe alſo be traunſlated. That is to ſaye the ceremoniall lawe, whyche preſcribeth vnto the Leuites, the kynde and ordre of theyr ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices muſte nowe be traunſlated or alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For Moyſes preſcribeth nothynge to thys prieſtehode, that is after the ordre of Melchiſideth. The prieſtes of thys order muſt folowe the exemple of theyr fyrſte and chyefe prieſte Ieſus Chriſte, who offered vp hys owne body and none other ſacrifice.</p>
                  <p>So muſte we, if we be prieſtes of that ordre offer vp our owne bodyes, a lyuelye and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſacrifice vnto God, alwayes ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynge<note place="margin">

And that lyke as they did by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of that lawe vſe manye ceremonies, in offerynge of their crifices: ſo might theyr mother holy church ordeine that aboute the ſacrifice of the maſſe (as they call it) oure prieſtes (but rather the popes prieſtes) myght (yea ought) to vſe all ſuch ceremonies, as we ſe daily vſed therin.</p>
                  <p>But nowe to oure purpoſe. The dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of prieſtes in the olde lawe, was not of force to reſtrayne the mariage of Prieſtes: Ergo, it is not of force nowe to wyth holde our prieſtes from mariage. If you hauc any thynge to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary of thys: I woulde you woulde ſet your pen to the paper, and trye your ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>hode therin.

If this wer gran<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would you ſay pretilie to vs in this matter.

                  <p>Seynge therefore, that it can not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſcripture, that the dedication of the prieſtes to God, doeth reſtrayne mariage: it is of Antichriſtes fayeth, to beleue that prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes dedicated vnto God maye not marye.</p>

                  <p>Wedlocke is honourable in all perſons and the bed there of vndefiled. I know your interpretation vpon thys place already (for I am ſure you will not make Paul to recant, as you did pore Baſil at Paules croſſe in Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, for exhortynge all menne to mariage, in hys boke of matrimony, not exemptyng the vowed anowterers) and therfore I wyll an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere vnto it.</p>
                  <p>You wyll ſaye, I am ſure, that in the time of Paule, prieſtes made no vowes of chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and therefore they dyd marye in thoſe dayes and longe after (as it appeareth by cronicles) and theyr mariage was honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and the bedde thereof vndefiled. But if the vowe of chaſtitie hadde bene then vſed amonge prieſtes, Paule would haue exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in hys Epiſtle.

But the circumſtaunce of the texte geueth rather the contrarie interpretation, &amp; that Paule dyd in thys place write thys ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence by the vniuerſal ſigne, bycauſe the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes were ſo greatelie geuen in the perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge of theyr vowes, that they thoughte all thynges lawfull that they had vowed to
<pb facs="tcp:5410:59"/> do, as appeareth by the vowe of the Iewes, wherof I haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before. They thought it lawefull for theym to ſlea Paule, bycauſe they had vowed his death. And yet the prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes &amp; elders could make thys anſwer to Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he bad the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take our ſauiour Chriſt, and iudge hyw accordynge to theyr lawe.</p>
                  <p>They coulde, I ſaye, anſwere hym, that it was not lawful for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to kil any man. And bycauſe they woulde not ſeme to be murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: they found the meanes to make Pilate theyr butcher (I ſaye not that oure prelates haue vſed the ſame practiſe) By like the way to vowe mennes death was not then inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For if it hadde: they myghte haue rydde Chriſte, wyth leſſe ado then they made. But I thynke not contrarye, but it fared by them then: euen as it dyd by vs of late dayes.</p>
                  <p>For as the numbre of the true chriſtians en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed: ſo dyd the byſhops &amp; hyghe prieſtes inuente wayes to brynge them to the pote.</p>
                  <p>There were appoynted .iiii. ſeſſions in one yeare moe then were wonte to be.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at any time to haue knowledge of them.

I wyl not ſaye that you &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that were then in your takyng, thought it no daunger vpon your othe to confeſſe all that you knewe to be of that opinion, which you then forſoke: notwythſtandynge you knewe that, that youre conteſſion ſhoulde be theyr death. By thys we maye coniect how it came to paſſe, that the Iewes thoughte it lawfull to vowe a mans deathe, and then to kill hym. For in Chriſtes time it was not ſo as it appeareth by that the hye prieſtes and elders ſought wytues agaynſt Chriſt, wher as it vowynge woulde haue ſerued, they myghte haue mads a more ſpedie diſpatche. They the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues might, or els haue cauſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to vow hys death, as I doubte not but ſome of theym dyd procure thoſe deuonte

                  <p>Take me not here (good maſter Shax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) as one that regardeth not an oth or vow But take me as one that wyll nother keepe othe nor vowe, the perfourmaunce whereof is againſt the commaundement of God.</p>
                  <p>If I therefore had vowed and ſworne by all the bokes vnder the ſunne that I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer marye, but lyue a lone lyfe wythout the lawefull companie of a womanne: yet if the rage of the fleſhe were ſuche that I ſhoulde be ready to ncye, as an horſſe, after euerye mans wyfe: I woulde not regarde my fole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhe othes and vowe, ſo far aboue my ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gth, but the promiſe that I made to kepe the commaundemente of God, whyche forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth me the verye deſyre of my neyghbours wyfe. But you wyll ſaye, it is not moughe to ſaye, I wyll not regarde my foleiſh othes and vow: but it be houeth, that in this caſe I ſhewe that I ought not to regarde them.</p>
                  <p>True it is in dede the caſe requireth ſo, and ſo maye I fone do. For thys is playne if the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of God (which I take to be the whole Euangelye of Chriſte) do forbid or dehort me from any kinde of thyng what ſo euer it be: no oth, nor vow, be it neuer ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiſedlie made, can bynde me to it.</p>

                  <p>I conclude therefore, that all the vowes, that are or can be made (be they neuer ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely or aduiſedly made) can not make it

                  <p>Fyrſt they ſay, that if al thinges be done of neceſſitie: what do we with ſcripture, what do we wyth lawes, why haue we preaching or teaching? To what purpoſe ſerue princes and publike miniſters in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune weale?

For by the ſcripture, the choſen numbre of Chriſte are led the ryghte waie to the land of promiſe (the new Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem) thorowe the wildernes of this world By the lawes: the wicked are kept vnder, ſo that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for fear of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, thei ſuffer the innocêt La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bes of Chriſte to liue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. By the preaching &amp; teachinge, are Goddes electe called in theyr tyme, and the weake and yonge ſcholers in Chriſte, made ſtrong and myghty ſouldiours to fyghte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our aduerſaries, the world, the deuill and our own fleſh. By the princes and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke miniſters are the lawes miniſtered to the auauncemente of Gods glorye, whether the lawes be wycked or Godly. For by the
